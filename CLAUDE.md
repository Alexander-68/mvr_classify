# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A tiny, dependency-free static web project — no package manager or test framework, and the only "build" is zipping the files for distribution (see below). Everything lives in a single self-contained HTML file (inline `<style>` and `<script>`, no external assets).

- `index.html` — the actual page: a fullscreen transparent `<canvas>` overlay carrying **button clusters** on top. Uses the Pointer Events API (`pointerdown`/`pointermove`/`pointerup`/`pointercancel`) to unify mouse, touch, and pen input in one code path, with a movement threshold (`DRAG_THRESHOLD` in the script) to distinguish a tap from a drag. See the button-cluster section below.
- `favicon.svg` — the page icon, referenced by `index.html`.

## Running / viewing

Just open the `index.html` file with a web browser.

## Build step

Package the shipped files into `mvr_annotate.zip`:

```bash
zip mvr_annotate.zip index.html favicon.svg
```

## Button clusters (the core UI idea)

The interactive UI is organized into **clusters**. A cluster is a vertically stacked group of buttons that behaves as one unit:

- **Grouped drag** — dragging anywhere on a cluster (a button or the gap between them) moves the *whole cluster*, never an individual button. Position is held as explicit `left`/`top` on the cluster element. The whole (scaled) box is clamped inside the canvas, and clusters **cannot overlap** — a drag slides along whichever axis stays clear of the other cluster (`hitsOtherCluster`).
- **Orientation flip (vertical ⇄ horizontal)** — a cluster is a vertical stack by default. Dragging it against the **top or bottom** canvas edge and *forcing it over* (over-dragging past the edge by `EDGE_FORCE` px) flips the whole cluster to a **horizontal row** (`.cluster.horizontal`: same buttons, the shared `-2px` edge and rounded corners just move to the X axis). It stays horizontal while docked against that edge and reverts to the vertical stack as soon as it's dragged back away. Detection lives in the drag branch of `pointermove`: it compares the *desired* (unclamped) top against the top/bottom bounds, and `setOrientation()` toggles the class (which reflows synchronously, so the box is re-measured immediately after to re-clamp). Left/right edges are unaffected — they never flip.
- **Grouped zoom** — pinch (two pointers) or mouse wheel scales the whole cluster via a `transform: scale`, so button size and text size grow/shrink together. Zoom is anchored to the pinch midpoint / cursor so the cluster zooms toward the focal point. Scale is clamped to `[MIN_SCALE, MAX_SCALE]` **and** capped so the box can never grow past the canvas edges; a zoom step that would overlap the other cluster is rejected (`applyZoom`).
- **Selection (per-cluster exclusivity is configurable)** — tapping a button marks it selected (white text → enlarged yellow text, yellow outline). A cluster created with `exclusive` (the default) allows only one selected button at a time — selecting another clears the previous one; a cluster created with `exclusive = false` lets every button toggle independently, so multiple can be selected at once. **Clusters are independent**: each tracks its own position, scale, and selection. The `exclusive` flag is the 5th arg to `createCluster`; `state.selected` holds the last-selected button (only meaningful for exclusive clusters), and the pointer-up deselect check keys off the button's own `.selected` class so non-exclusive toggling works.
- **Select/deselect + long-press, and the timeline `status`** — pressing a button toggles its selection, and whether the press was a short tap or a **long-press** (held still, no drag, for `LONG_PRESS_MS`) tags the injected timeline event. All four combinations sound a **ding on select** and a lower **"dong" on deselect** (`playDong`, an octave below `playDing`). The event is always `{"marker": <label>}` plus an optional `status`:
  - short tap, not selected → **select**, no `status` (bare `{marker}`)
  - short tap, already selected → **deselect**, `status: "finish"`
  - long-press, not selected → **select**, `status: "on"`
  - long-press, already selected → **deselect**, `status: "off"`

  The hold is tracked by a `setTimeout` (sets `state.longPress`) started on `pointerdown`; a drag (crossing `DRAG_THRESHOLD`) or a second finger cancels it. The select/deselect branch lives in the pointer-up handler; `injectEvent()` builds the JSON.
- **Pop-up submenus (host → modifiers)** — a button can own a **transient submenu cluster**. Several cluster-2 buttons are registered hosts (`submenuHosts`, a `button → config` Map): long-pressing **Injection**, **Hemostasis**, **Biopsy**, or **Polyp** opens an *exclusive* submenu of that host's modifiers. Each submenu is a normal cluster built by `createCluster` (so it drags/pinches/flips and calls `reportInteractive()`), created with `transient = true` — which now only means it's **not built at page load** and its **selection** is discarded on close; its **position/zoom/orientation DO persist** (`saveLayout` no longer skips transient clusters, keyed by the submenu's stable `id`). It carries `state.markerOverride = <host>`, so its buttons inject `{"marker":<host>,"modifier":<label>, status?}` — the marker is the host button, the pressed submenu button is the `modifier`, and `status` follows the usual rules (bare / `finish` / `on` / `off`). **Spawn placement**: on open it restores its saved spot if one exists and is still clear; otherwise `placeSubmenuInOpenSpace()` finds open space that doesn't overlap any other cluster — preferring beside the host (right, left, below, above), then a grid scan of the canvas, and only sitting beside the host on top of another cluster if nothing is clear. The chosen spot is saved on open, and every drag/zoom re-saves it (`saveLayout` mutates the in-memory `savedLayout` so a re-opened submenu reads its latest position within the session too). Lifecycle: `openSubmenu(host)` runs when the host is **long-press-selected**; `closeSubmenu(host)` runs whenever the host is deselected (either way), removing the element and splicing it out of `clusters`. Both hooks live in the pointer-up handler, keyed on `submenuHosts.get(btn)`; each config holds its own live `submenu` (or `null`). A long-press **opens** the submenu whether the host is currently unselected (selects it) or already selected with no submenu open (keeps it selected, re-reports `on`); it only deselects+closes when the submenu is already open (or on a short tap). Register a new host with `registerSubmenu(label, id, modifiers)`.
- **Tap vs. drag** — a pointer that moves less than `DRAG_THRESHOLD` counts as a tap (toggles selection); more counts as a drag (reposition). A two-finger gesture is always a pinch, never a select.
- **Uniform button size** — every button in a cluster has the **same box size**: there's no fixed width (buttons hug the text), so the cluster is as wide as its widest label and the flex column's default `align-items: stretch` makes every button match that width. `font-size`/`font-weight` are constant (they drive layout), so selecting a button never changes its box or reflows the stack. The label lives in an inner `<span class="label">`; the idle label sits at `transform: scale(0.8)` and the selected one at `scale(1)`, so the selected text enlarges *within its existing button area* rather than growing the button. "Bold" emphasis is faked with an extra text-shadow (not a weight change) to keep layout fixed, and `overflow: hidden` guards against spill.
- **Tight vertical stacking** — `gap: 0` and a `-2px` top margin on every button after the first overlap adjacent borders into a single shared line: one button's bottom outline *is* the next button's top outline. Internal corners are square; only the cluster's outer corners are rounded. The selected button gets `z-index: 1` so its full yellow outline paints above the shared edges.
- **Appearance** — buttons have a transparent background with white text (yellow when selected), a `2px` border, and a text-shadow for legibility over the live camera preview. Horizontal padding is kept tight (`10px`) so there's little blank space beside the labels. Clusters are **not** named or tagged — just buttons.

Clusters are built in JS by `createCluster(labels, left, top)` from a plain array of label strings, so **button names, counts, and the number of clusters are all configurable** — edit the arrays / `createCluster` calls near the bottom of the script. Current clusters:

- Cluster 1: `Illeum, R.Colon, Tv.Colon, L.Colon, S.Colon, Rectum`
- Cluster 2 (non-exclusive selection): `Withdrawal, Injection, Hemostasis, Biopsy, Polyp`
- Polyp submenu (transient, exclusive; opened by long-pressing Polyp): `Forceps, Cold Snare, Hot Snare, EMR, ESD, EFTR, APC/Ablation, Surgical`
- Hemostasis submenu (transient, exclusive; opened by long-pressing Hemostasis): `Hemoclip, Thermal, APC, Injection, Band, Topical, Surgical`
- Biopsy submenu (transient, exclusive; opened by long-pressing Biopsy): `Forceps, FNA/FNB, Brush, Snare, Suction`
- Injection submenu (transient, exclusive; opened by long-pressing Injection): `Lift, Hemostasis, Botox, Steroid, Tattoo, Contrast`

## Important: notifying the native Android host

This page is loaded as a transparent overlay on top of native Android UI. **Any interactive element MUST call:**

```js
window.MvrOverlay?.reportInteractive();
```

**on the action that begins the interaction** (e.g. at the top of the `pointerdown` handler, and on `wheel` for zoom) — see the calls in the cluster handlers in `index.html`. This tells the native Android app that the gesture landed on a web-UI element, so it doesn't let the touch propagate through to the native UI underneath. Without this call, taps on web elements would fall through to Android as if the overlay wasn't there. This rule is unconditional: whenever you add a new interactive element or gesture, wire up `reportInteractive()` on its interaction-start event.

## Key implementation details in index.html

- Canvas is sized to `window.innerWidth/innerHeight * devicePixelRatio` and uses `ctx.setTransform(dpr, 0, 0, dpr, 0, 0)` so drawing coordinates stay in CSS pixels while the backing store matches the display's real resolution.
- `html, body { overflow: hidden }` plus `#stage`/`canvas` using `position: fixed/absolute; inset: 0` keeps the canvas pinned edge-to-edge with no scrollbar-induced gaps.
- Each cluster's position is stored as explicit `left`/`top` pixel values with `transform-origin: top left` so the origin stays pinned while `transform: scale(...)` zooms it. Dragging updates `left`/`top` directly (screen-pixel deltas map 1:1 regardless of scale); `clampOrigin()` keeps the cluster's top-left corner reachable, and the `resize` handler re-clamps after a viewport resize.
- Per-cluster gesture state lives in a `state` object with a `pointers` map (pointerId → position) and a `mode` of `null` (pending) / `'drag'` / `'pinch'`. A second pointer switches to pinch and cancels any pending tap; lifting back to one pointer rebases the drag so the cluster doesn't jump.
- `touch-action: none` on the cluster and its buttons prevents the browser from hijacking touch gestures as scroll/zoom during drag/pinch; the `wheel` handler is registered `{ passive: false }` and calls `preventDefault()` so wheel zoom doesn't scroll the page.
